# Language independent code generation

... __in next to no time__!!

This package can generate code in any language. You can think of it as search
and replace pattern, just a bit more advanced.

Here's an example of how it can be used.

```php
Authanram\Generators\Generator::make()
    ->template('first {{ second }} third {{ fourth }}')
    ->input(['second' => '2nd', 'fourth' => '4TH'])
    ->fillCallback(fn ($input) => [
        'second' => $input->str('second')->upper(),
        'fourth' => $input->str('fourth')->lower(),
    ])->get();
```

This will lead to the following output:

```
first 2ND third 4th
```

Under the hood a simple search and replace routine will take place.
