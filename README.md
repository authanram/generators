## Package Description

This package is about __language independent code generation__, in next to no
time.

## Basic usage example

Here's an example of how it can be used in a very basic way:

```php
(new Authanram\Generators\Generator())
    ->withTemplate('first {{ second }} third {{ fourth }}')
    ->withInput(['second' => '2nd', 'fourth' => '4th']);
```

This will lead to the following output:

```shell
first 2nd third 4th
```
